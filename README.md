Combination of Particle Filter and Kalman Filter approaches in a simple real-time object tracking example. WE aim at using the best of both in order to design a reliable object tracking algorithm for simple scenarios.

## Overview of the Algorithm

1. We use **Image Processing** to obtain a binary image. Ideally, we want everything to be black except the ball (white). This makes the task easier for the Particle Filter.
2. We then use **Particle Filter** to estimate the position of the object, putting more weight on white regions. We keep the centroid of the particle cloud.
3. We use **Kalman Filter** on top of the Particle filter. That is, the measurements from the Particle Fitler are passed to the Kalman Filter so that the motion model can be applied. This allows our system to be robust to occlusions.
5. The value of `Q` (measurement noise) is modified (we make it higher) when there are occulusions. This is to ensure that the Kalman Filter takes protagonism in this cases, using the motion model to estimate the position of the object (measurements are poor). 

**Note:** The initial position of the object, i.e. (x1, x2) and speeds (v1,v2) [acceleration might also be considered], are obtained using the Particle filter, which are then used to initialize the Kalman Filter. 

## Image procesing
- Techniques to filter the image?
- Criteria to modify `Q`? Measure roundness? What is it about? 
- Scene change check?

## Particle Filter
- Re-sampling method used? How are weights allocated?
- Number of particles?
- Initialization of the particles?
- Model of the motion of the particles used?

## Kalman Filter

We have used a Linear Kalman filter. It was simple, easy to implement and sufficed our requirements. However, its initialization is very important. In particular we have:

- Need of initialization of the initial state `x` and the initial covariance matrix `Sigma`.
- In addition, the Kalman Filter requires matrices `A`, `B` and `C`.
  - `A` is defined according to the motion model that is used (e.g. for constant speed is 4X4, for constant acceleration it is 6X6)
  - `B` is usually used when there is some input signal from the object/agent being tracked/localized. In our case, a simple object tracking, where the agent is passive (ball), B is not required since we do not use any control signal.
  - `C` is used as  the mapping between measurement and state. In our case, the first two coefficients of the state are the position (x and y axis) which is what the measurement is capable of obtaining. However, the other parameters in the state are hidden and thus no measurements are obtained. Nonetheless, some simple techniques could be used in order to estimate them (**however this could compromise the performance of the motion model**, since we might measure speeds accelerations erroneously)
  
- Process noise `R` and Measurement noise `Q`. These matrices are very relevant.  If `R >> Q` then Kalman assumes our motion model is not good and puts more weight on them mesaurements. Else if `Q >> R`,  then Kalman Filter assumes the measurements are not really trustful and Kalman puts more weight on the motion model. **Contrary to what we have done in the labs, we do update the value of Q, according to some criteria to measure the uncertainty of the measurement (image processing)**


###Â Code structure of Kalman

I have worked on files `KalmanInit.m`, `KalmanPredict.m` and `KalmanUpdate.m`.



### Motion model

We have used two models. Constant speed and constant acceleration. For the example of pinball, constant speed outperformed the constant acceleration model.

### Kalman Filter
- `KalmanInit.m`: **Initialize** the parameters of the Kalman Filter, i.e. `A`, `B`, `C`, `Q` and `R`. The motion model is designed in this function. If `mmodel = 0`, then constant speed model is used. If `mmodel = 1` then constant acceleration model is used. 
- `KalmanPredict.m`: **Prediction** step of Kalman Filter. We use the motion model to estimate/predict the position of the object.
- `KalmanUpdate.m`: **Update** step of Kalman Filter. We use the masurements provided by the PF to reduce the uncertainty of our prediction.
